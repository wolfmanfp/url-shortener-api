# URL Shortener API - Jakarta EE + Jakarta NoSQL

To run this API, you need the latest Payara Community Edition (https://www.payara.fish/downloads/payara-platform-community-edition/), 
since this is the only runtime which supports both Jakarta EE 10 and Eclipse MicroProfile, both of which is needed by Jakarta NoSQL.
